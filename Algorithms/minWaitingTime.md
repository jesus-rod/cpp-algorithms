#  Minimum waiting time

<div class=""><p>
  You're given a non-empty array of positive integers representing the amounts
  of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be executed
  at a time, but the queries can be executed in any order.
</p>
<p>
  A query's <b>waiting time</b> is defined as the amount of time that it must
  wait before its execution starts. In other words, if a query is executed
  second, then its waiting time is the duration of the first query; if a query
  is executed third, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the
  first two queries.
</p>
<p>
  Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all
  of the queries. For example, if you're given the queries of durations
  <span>[1, 4, 5]</span>, then the total waiting time if the queries were
  executed in the order of <span>[5, 1, 4]</span> would be
  <span>(0) + (5) + (5 + 1) = 11</span>. The first query of duration
  <span>5</span> would be executed immediately, so its waiting time would be
  <span>0</span>, the second query of duration <span>1</span> would have to wait
  <span>5</span> seconds (the duration of the first query) to be executed, and
  the last query would have to wait the duration of the first two queries before
  being executed.
</p>
<p>Note: you're allowed to mutate the input array.</p>
