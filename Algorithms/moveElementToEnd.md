#  Move element to end

<div class=""><p>
  You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves
  all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns
  the array.
</p>
<p>
  The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input
  array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
<span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">toMove</span> = 2
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// the numbers 1, 3, and 4 could be ordered differently</span>
</pre></div>
